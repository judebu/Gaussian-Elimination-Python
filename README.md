# Gaussian Elimination in Python

## Description
This project implements Gaussian Elimination to solve systems of linear equations. The script includes functions for row operations, error calculation, and matrix manipulation.

## Features
- Row swapping for partial pivoting
- Row reduction to echelon form
- Computation of relative error for numerical stability
- Uses NumPy for efficient matrix operations

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/judebu/Gaussian-Elimination-Python.git
2. Run the script in Python: python gaussian_elimination.py
